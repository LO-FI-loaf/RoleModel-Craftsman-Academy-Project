# RoleModel-Craftsman-Academy-Project

Date:     2/19/2023
Author:   Joel Bos
time spent: 13 hrs

instructions:
1. open terminal and type "cd weather"
2. Type in terminal bin/rails server
3. go to browser and paste this http://localhost:3000/pages?user_input=0.0.0.0&commit=Submit
    -I had an issue where the page would encounter an error when run without params already placed in the url, hence the user_input already being set.
4. This will take you to the page where you can enter your IP and press enter. It will show you the hourly forecast for the next 7 days
