instructions:
1. run web server
2. go to http://localhost:3000/pages?user_input=0.0.0.0&commit=Submit
   -  same issue as before with blank user_input. api has nothing to parse and throws an error. I have included a system test as requested but it may not work       because of this issue. I hope I wrote it right.
3. enter IP address and view temperatures (verify dates are correct)
4. the dropdown menu will now store your IP address in it, click the menu and select an address, then press submit.
